Interfacing considerations

Like DTL, TTL is a current-sinking logic since a current must be drawn from inputs to bring them to a logic 0 level. At low input voltage, the TTL input sources current which must be absorbed by the previous stage. The maximum value of this input current is about 1.6 mA for a standard TTL gate.[19] The input source has to be low-resistive enough (<500 O) so that the flowing current creates only a negligible voltage drop (<0.4 V) across it, for the input to be considered as a logical "0" (with a 0.4 V "noise margin", see below). The output stage of the most common TTL gates is specified to function correctly when driving up to 10 standard input stages (a fanout of 10). TTL inputs are sometimes simply left floating to provide a logical "1", though this usage is not recommended.

Standard TTL circuits operate with a 5-volt power supply. A TTL input signal is defined as "low" when between 0 V and 0.8 V with respect to the ground terminal, and "high" when between 2 V and VCC (5 V),[20][21] and if a voltage signal ranging between 0.8 V and 2.0 V is sent into the input of a TTL gate, there is no certain response from the gate and therefore it is considered "uncertain" (precise logic levels vary slightly between sub-types and by temperature). TTL outputs are typically restricted to narrower limits of between 0.0 V and 0.4 V for a "low" and between 2.4 V and VCC for a "high", providing at least 0.4 V of noise immunity. Standardization of the TTL levels is so ubiquitous that complex circuit boards often contain TTL chips made by many different manufacturers selected for availability and cost, compatibility being assured; two circuit board units off the same assembly line on different successive days or weeks might have a different mix of brands of chips in the same positions on the board; repair is possible with chips manufactured years (sometimes over a decade) later than original components. Within usefully broad limits, logic gates can be treated as ideal Boolean devices without concern for electrical limitations. The 0.4V noise margins are adequate because of the low output impedance of the driver stage, that is, a large amount of noise power superimposed on the output is needed to drive an input into an undefined region.

In some cases (e.g., when the output of a TTL logic gate needs to be used for driving the input of a CMOS gate), the voltage level of the "totem-pole" output stage at output logical "1" can be increased closer to VCC by connecting an external resistor between the V3 collector and the positive rail. It pulls up the V5 cathode and cuts-off the diode.[22] However, this technique actually converts the sophisticated "totem-pole" output into a simple output stage having significant output resistance when driving a high level (determined by the external resistor).

----------------------------------

Pull-down resistors can be safely used with CMOS logic gates because the inputs are voltage-controlled. TTL logic inputs that are left un-connected inherently float high, and require a much lower valued pull-down resistor to force the input low. A standard TTL input at logic "1" is normally operated assuming a source current of 40 µA, and a voltage level above 2.4 V, allowing a pull-up resistor of no more than 50 Kohms; whereas the ttl input at logic "0" will be expected to sink 1.6 mA at a voltage below 0.8 V, requiring a pull-down resistor less than 500 ohms.[1] Holding unused TTL inputs low consumes more current. For that reason, pull-up resistors are preferred in TTL circuits.

Single Gate Pull-up Resistor Value
RMAX = 150K
(...)Then we can see that while there may be a maximum allowable resistive value, the resistance value for pull-up resistors is not usually that critical with values ranging from about 10k to 100k ohms.

Multiple Gate Pull-up Resistor Value (10 inputs)
RMAX = 15K
(...)Again as before, this 15kO resistance may be the exact calculated value, but leaves no room for error so reducing the voltage drop to one volt (or any value you want) gives a resistive value of only 5kO’s.

Single Gate Pull-down Resistor Value
RMAX = 2K
(...)Therefore if we assume a voltage drop of only 0.4 volts across the resistor, a quick calculation would give us a single pull-down resistor value of 1kO’s
(...)Also, connecting inputs together will result in a larger current through the resistor. For example, a fan-in of 10 will result in 10 x 400uA = 4.0mA requiring a pull-down resistance of 100O’s.

But you might be thinking, why use a pull-down resistor at all when a direct connection to ground (0V) would produce the required LOW?. A direct connection to ground without the pull-down resistor would certainly work in most cases, but as the gates input is permanently tied to ground, the use of a resistor limits the current flowing out of the input thereby reducing power loss while still maintaining a logic “0” condition.


Rule of thumb:
-Pull-up resistors (max):
	55K per input;
	27K - 2 inputs;
	18K - 3 inpuys;
	13K - 4 inputs;
	4,7K - 10 inputs.

-Pull-down resistors (max):
	1K per input;
	470R - 2 inputs;
	330R - 3 inpuys;
	240R - 4 inputs;
	100R - 10 inputs.
